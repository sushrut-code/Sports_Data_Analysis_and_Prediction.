âš½ Striker Performance Analysis & Classification
A complete data science project analyzing striker performance based on various metrics. The project includes data preprocessing, EDA, statistical testing, clustering (KMeans), feature engineering, and classification using Logistic Regression.

ðŸ“Š Problem Statement
Goal: Analyze and classify strikers into 3 categories â€” Regular Strikers, Good Strikers, and Best Strikers â€” based on their performance metrics.

ðŸ§ª Tools & Technologies Used
  Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
  
  scikit-learn (StandardScaler, KMeans, LogisticRegression)
  
  statsmodels (OLS Regression)
  
  SciPy (ANOVA, Pearson correlation)
  
  Visual Studio

   Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values using median imputation

Label encoded Footedness and Marital Status

One-hot encoded Nationality

Created a new feature: Total Contribution Score

ðŸ“Š Statistical Analysis
Normality Test: Shapiro-Wilk

ANOVA: Tested if consistency rates differ across nationalities

Pearson Correlation: Checked if Hold-up Play relates to Consistency

Linear Regression: Determined how much Hold-up Play influences Consistency

ðŸ¤– Machine Learning
Applied KMeans Clustering to group strikers into:

Regular Strikers

Good Strikers

Best Strikers

Trained a Logistic Regression Classifier to predict striker type

Achieved ~93â€“97% accuracy

Evaluated using:

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1)

You can input any new player stats like this:

python

Edit
new_player = {
    'Goals Scored': 20,
    'Assists': 10,
    'Shots on Target': 35,
    ...
    'Nationality_France': 1,
    ...
}
And the model will return:

Edit
Predicted Striker Type: Best Striker
